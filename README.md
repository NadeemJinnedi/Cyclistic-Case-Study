# Cyclistic-Case-Study

## Overview
This repository houses a comprehensive case study conducted by Google on Cyclistic, a bike-share company. The case study explores various facets of Cyclistic's operations, leveraging data and analysis to provide insights and recommendations.

In this case study, I have analyzed historical data from a Chicago-based bike-share company to identify trends in how their customers use bikes differently. The main tools used are Excel/Google Sheets, SQL & Tableau.
